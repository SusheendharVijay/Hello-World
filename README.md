# Hello-World
Repo of my stupid ideas and thoughts.

# On Conway's Game of Life:
The celllular automation depends on the initial set of live points, some surivive ,some go extinct immediately, some just stagnate and never develop or die out. Seems eerily similar to evolution. Will the human pattern die out? Maybe evolution is just a big game of life grid.
